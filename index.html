        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jocelyn Higuera. I am 18 years old and am currently a freshman at the University of California Riverside. I have lived in California my whole life, so traveling is something I always hope to do in the future, whether with friends, family, or alone. That being said, I enjoy spending a lot of time at home with my family. Spending time with people I love and care about is an essential part of who I am.  I enjoy helping others in any way  I can.  From a very young age, I knew that I wanted to become a teacher to encourage people to follow their dreams and believe that anything truly is possible.<br><br>
      As someone working to become a future educator, I take my duties to get there very seriously. I have younger siblings who go to school and receive homework. Often they come home and do not understand what to do on their homework, which is where I step in and put my skills to the test. I will take time out of my day and make up fun games or easy worksheets to help them understand how to get things done without losing their attention and keeping their interest in work 100% of the time. Once I saw I was getting the hang of it with my siblings, I figured it was time I look for a tutoring job. I ended up getting a job as a tutor pretty fast. For it to be my first time officially tutoring someone, I did very well, and the student would often tell me I was a good tutor and consider teaching.<br><br>
      I have kept the comment that the student left with me and have taken it with me everywhere. I remind myself of what I want to do with my life. Ever since then, I have kept my job as a tutor and have not stopped. I always ask the students I tutor and their parents a survey to fill out once I have completed my job with them. In the surveys, I have never received a negative comment; in fact, the complete opposite the comments are always lovely, and often those past clients end up referring me when someone they know needs a tutor.Not only do I tutor, but I also volunteer my time working with children at schools. I tend to focus my time a lot on those who struggle because I know what it feels like to feel left behind or not understand something. That is why I devote my time to helping others, trying my best to encourage them to stay in school and follow their dreams because anything is possible with effort and hard work. I was working at these schools as a temporary admin, but recently one school liked my work and contacted me and offered me an actual position at the school as a tutor. Since then, I have quit bouncing from one school to another and now have a steady job.
